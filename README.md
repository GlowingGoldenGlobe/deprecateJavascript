# deprecateJavascript
Deprecate JavaScript. JavaScript runs on Python. Python can do everything, except, binary and quantum. Python isn't good enough, either, but it's not entirely wrong. Here is a suggestion for a new programming language... <br><a href="https://glowinggoldenglobe.github.io/deprecateJavascript/clearsyntax.html">See inside</a>.<br><br>Python for GUI (graphics user interface). Python for internet data fetching (Python for browsing). Python for Artificial Intelligence. Python for 3D (e.g., about open3d). Python for physics simulation software (O3DE). Python for auto-inquiries to GPT-4 ChatGPT-Plus subscription from openai (beware of tokens per text sent and received, or, maybe subscription only ??) to build micro-robot-composite humanoids and the 3D simulations that will power their robot-operating-system (e.g., ROS2).<br><br>Since Python has some flaws, it should also be replaced, or, rather, OVERHAULED (RE-BUILT).<br><br>Of course, deprecate JavaScript via transition to "ClearSyntax" or something well, like it. <br><br>Utilize this to build a programming language, kindly.<br><br>This Electronic Folder: Modifications<br><br>
