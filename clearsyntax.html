Summary

Note:
N:
x = This is some text. "This is some more text." And, these three sentences are part of the same continuous string.
x = I(1)
x = DN(3.14)
x = B(true)
x = L(): I(1) ',' I(5) ',' L(): DN(9.17) ',' Her brother said, "That's a car." ',' DN(5.33) L(E). ',' "Hi! World!"
x = Length(x)
x = F(parameters = null):
  x = This is a variable inside of a function - it has local scope.
  N: global x     #if python programming, which this isn't, therefore, as follows:
  G(): x
  N: Now, variable x has global scope, and it's making an error because it's a function variable name calling itself.
y = DN(2.79)
x = F():
  G(): y
  N: Print y to the terminal window, as follows:
  P(): y
  args = L(): y + 1 ',' DN(1.76)
  return args
Loop(if x in range(1 thru 5) ):
  P(x)
  x += 1
N: some commands to be used about Loop():     , as follows:
  break
  continue
N: concatenate string S(): ... S(E).   or multi-line string (default) S(M): ... S().
x = Some text+():, and, then, some more text.
N: +(): is the concatenate command, which can be altered, temporarily, per command line, as follows:
N: To alter the command designation for the next command line:
+(D):
  varAddSomethingElse():
Note: Also, about string command name designation, as follows:
S(D):
  SomeBeginning():
  StringEnd().
N: Dictionary (only when absolutely necessary)
x = D(): keyName1 ':' This is some value about key name 1. ',' key_Name_2':'B(true)
N: class
x = C():
    N: code...
N: tuple
x = T(): I(12) ',' "Hello! Do you have the time?"

1. Do not have to comment quotation marks.

x = string - This is a string.

N: concatenation: string

Concatenate():
  N: User designation of concatenation sequence of characters allowed. The default is, as follows:
  +():
  
x_2 = This is a string = some other text goes here. +():This is some more text. +():3.14159678

N: Math: addition
x_3 = DN(10.75)
x_4 = I(2)
x_4 = DN(x_4)
x_5 = x_3 + x_4

N: Number-Categeroy: Integer
y = I(0)
z = DN(3.14159678)

N: String Designation

S():

N: Multi-Line String; Also, S(M): is the default.

S(M):This is some text. And,
this is some more
text.
 As you can see - this 
is some more text.S().

N: Temporarily set a String() command designation, as follows:

S(D):
  SomeOtherName():
  SomeOtherEndName().
  
S(R).
N: or
S(R):
N: or
S(D):
  S():
  S().
Note: User defined String() Alternative-Designation about symbols or characters in-between the function curve brackets is disallowed, for example: S(X):     is disallowed.
  
f = F():
 N: code...
 Note: code...
 return args
a = L():
  var_1 = This is a string.
  var_2 = I(1)
  var_3 = DN(3.14)
  var_c = L():
    var_1b = This is, also, a string.
    var_2b = This another string, in this new list.
    var_3b = DN(7.25)
    var_4b = B(true)
    var_5b = B(false)
N: This is a comment.
Note: This is, also, a comment.
N: Notice how the list([]) is built using a function (): symbol, with new lines to designate each list item, and no commas to designate separation between items in a list.
b = L(): item_1 ',' item_2 ',' item_3
N: Dictionary
Note: I don't see why they want to use a dictionary.
c = D(): key_name_1 ':' value one here. ',' key_name_2 ':' DN(1.5)

2. Do not have dictionaries, unless they have to be used.

3. Do not have classes, unless they have to be used.

N: class ()
N: the class() command is written as, var_name = C():
N: i.e., the class command is written as, C():     , as follows:
a = C():
 self...
 etc. see Python classes

4. Do not have tuples, unless they have to be used..

N: loops
var_list = L(): DN(3.14159678) ',' I(2) ',' She said he said, "This looks well."
var_length = Length(var_list)
Loop(if x in range(1 thru var_length) ):
  x = (x + 1)
  N: Print is designated by the command P():
  P(): x
