Foreword
When there are multiple examples, per generality, use the first example script lines format about how you write your scripts, where the reason is because it will make a more uniform coding about the many people reading writing code in the world, and many people reading other people's script documents and excerpts in the world.






Section 1     String Command





Note: String
S():This is a string.





Note: Variable
x = This is a string.






x = S():This
is
a string on multiple
lines.S().






Note: It looks like (it seems that) "M" about S(M): is never necessary.
x = S(M):This
is
a string on multiple
lines, and "M" about x = S(M): is a
default.S().





x = S():This is a string on a single line.
x = This is a string on a single line. The first space is after the equals sign is not processed as a variable assignment value. The space below, between this variable line and the next command line is not assigned to this variable as a part of the variable value, and the reason is because this string is not ended with the string end syntax command.

x = This is a string.





Section 2     Integer Command





x = 0
x = 1





Note: Integers don't have decimal places.





Note: A numerical value assigned to a variable is processed as a number about mathematical quantity, only if alpha numeric characters are not present in the value description. "value description" explanation: where x = 0, x is the variable name, and 0 is the value assignment, since it's a description about a value about a variable, I described, above, as a "value description" (one might say, as per plain English).





x = 1
y = 1
a = x + y





Note: Below, the type of the variable x is an integer type of variable, and it's the same as the type of the variable y.
x = 1
y = I(1)
a = I(x) + I(y)






Section 3     Decimal Numeral Command





Note: (1) x is re-assigned a value. (2) Both of the values assigned were the variable type "Decimal Numeral" - designated as DN.
x = 1.254
x = DN(3.14159678)






Section 4     List Command





Note: (1) A list is a variable which can hold many variables. (2) They can be written in a line, where they are each separated by ',' . (3) Or, they can be written on multiple lines where each new line is at least one blank space (space-bar key space value) distant from the left vertical alignment with the variable name declaration place associated with the value. Example, as follows:
x = L(): 1 ',' 2
x = L():
 1
 2
x = L():1','2
x = L():Text','Some more text.
x = L(): 1 ',' This is some text.
x = L():
 I(7)
 This is some text.
x = L():S():This
 is a multi-line
 string.S().







Section 5     Print Command




Note: Print is designated as P, and the command is written as P():
x = text is on this line "Hello!"
P(): x




x = "Hello"
y = 1089.135
P():
 x
 y





Section 6     Function Command






x = F():
    Note: code...
    return null
    
    
    



h = F(parameters):
    
    a = 0
    x = parameters + 1
    
    return x
  
y = 8  
x(y)






Note: Variables sent to a function when calling a function are often called, arguments, arg or args.
args = 8
x(args)
y = x(args)
P(): y
    



    
    
Note: Variables returned in a function return command are, also, often called, arguments, arg or args.
x = F():
  y = 1
  N: To print y to the terminal window, run the following command:
  P(): y
  args = L(): y + 1 ',' DN(1.76)
  return args






Section 7     Concatenate Command





x = text values here
y = more text in a line, here
a = x +(): y

P():
    a

N: concatenate string S(): ...    or multi-line string (default) S(): ... S().
x = Some text+():, and, then, some more text.
N: +(): is the concatenate command, which can be altered, temporarily, per command line, as follows:
N: To alter the command designation for the next command line:
+(D):
  varAddSomethingElse():
Note: Also, about string command name designation, as follows:
S(D):
  SomeBeginning():
  StringEnd().





x = 8
y = text

x = S(): 8
a = x +(): y

P():
    a






x = 8.95
y = text .
a = y +(): S(): x

P():
    a




    

Section 8     Math Commands




Note: It's like math.




a = 1.7
b = 3.14

r = a + b

x = ( a - b )

h = ( a + b ) * 2

o = ( a + b ) / 2

P():

    a + b

P():

    r
    x
    h
    o






Section 9     Conditional Command





If():
  Note: then...




x = 8
y = 1
If(y != x):
 P(): y doesn't equal x.
 P(): B(false)




x = 1
y = 1
If(x != y):
    P():B(false)
ElseIf():
    P():B(true)





x = 1
y = 1
If( x = ( y + 1 ) ):
    P(): B ( true )
ElseIf( x == y ):
    P(): 
        x is y.
        B ( false )






Section 10    Loop Command






Loop(if x in range(1 thru 5) ):
  P(x)
  x += 1
  
  
  
  
  
N: some commands to be used about Loop():     , as follows:
  break
  continue
  
  
  
  
  
Loop():
    If():
        break
    ElseIf():
        continue




N: There must be criteria written in the Loop(...): command at "...".






  








x = F():
  G(): y
  N: Print y to the terminal window, as follows:
  P(): y
  args = L(): y + 1 ',' DN(1.76)
  return args






Note: Value Assignment to a Variable Name
x = A variable assigned an alpha numeric character(s) value.





Note: Value Assignment to a Variable Name
, where "x", a character or set of characters, preceding any first equals sign 





Note:





x = I(1)
x = DN(3.14)
x = B(true)
x = L(): I(1) ',' I(5) ',' L(): DN(9.17) ',' Her brother said, "That's a car." ',' DN(5.33) L(E). ',' "Hi! World!"
x = Length(x)
x = F(parameters = null):
  x = This is a variable inside of a function - it has local scope.
  N: global x     #if python programming, which this isn't, therefore, as follows:
  G(): x
  N: Now, variable x has global scope, and it's making an error because it's a function variable name calling itself.
y = DN(2.79)
x = F():
  G(): y
  N: Print y to the terminal window, as follows:
  P(): y
  args = L(): y + 1 ',' DN(1.76)
  return args
Loop(if x in range(1 thru 5) ):
  P(x)
  x += 1
N: some commands to be used about Loop():     , as follows:
  break
  continue
N: concatenate string S(): ...    or multi-line string (default) S(): ... S().
x = Some text+():, and, then, some more text.
N: +(): is the concatenate command, which can be altered, temporarily, per command line, as follows:
N: To alter the command designation for the next command line:
+(D):
  varAddSomethingElse():
Note: Also, about string command name designation, as follows:
S(D):
  SomeBeginning():
  StringEnd().
N: Dictionary (only when absolutely necessary)
x = D(): keyName1 ':' This is some value about key name 1. ',' key_Name_2':'B(true)
N: class
x = C():
    N: code...
N: tuple
x = T(): I(12) ',' "Hello! Do you have the time?"
